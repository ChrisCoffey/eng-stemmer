# English Language Stemmer

https://travis-ci.org/ChrisCoffey/eng-stemmer.svg?branch=master

This is an implementation of the [Porter2 Stemmer](http://snowballstem.org/algorithms/english/stemmer.html). There are still some bugs, but its quite accurate.

I wrote this for my own learning, but someone else may find it of use.
